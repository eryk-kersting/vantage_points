This code shows ways to arrange people in the best way at an airport baggage claim. At the airport baggage claim, peple often block each other's line of sight which results in people not being able to see their baggage.
To run the code, 
python n_points <num viewers> <repulsive force> <repulsice distance>

n-points-line-random.py:  For baggage claim best configurations
Usage: $ python3 n-points-line-random.py <number of points> <number of trials>

n-points-trials.py: For inverse-square-distance central point.
Usage: $ python3 n-points-trials.py <number points> <repulse_force> <repulse_distance>
